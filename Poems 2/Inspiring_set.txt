There will come a day
When the fear of death will be the favored joke
Passed amongst corpses
And they′re already laughing

My love, please don't be afraid
But there will come a day
When field mice play in our empty sockets
When our bones become homes for living creatures
Other than our egos
And when time will jostle our skeletons
Out of the composition that is me and you
And will write with us love letters that spell I owe you eternity

If we believe in life after death,
Then I often wonder why we assume the dead like coffins
When people were never meant to live in boxes
So I pray that our children will have the
Good sense to leave us a little wiggle room
Leave us exposed like stray dogs in a thunderstorm
And I will hear the breeze but I will not know it as the breeze
And I will feel the rain but not know it as the rain
And I will behold the sky but not know it as the sky

Instead, I will hear the breeze and think it is your laugh
Returned into the hearth of my ear
And I will feel the rain and think that it is the
Pinprick of your kiss and when the rain is tender
I will know that something has softened you
And when the rain is violent
I will know that something has shaken you
And, in this new found understanding
Without eyes or ears or hands or lips
Our bare bones will make love in the dirt;
Never knowing our nakedness
Imagine, the wind coursing through a calligraphy of weeds

In our disrepair we have grown gardens of ourselves
Sprouts of curious grass shooting from our eye sockets

Our knuckles, hard, smooth skipping stones meant for children′s play
And the devilish sun,
Picking its way through your missing teeth and
Neither of us can keep from smiling these days
And the days go unnoticed and the nights go unslept
And we talk with our souls through the holes in our ribs
Where the organs once sat

Imagine, your skull and mine both reduced to grins
Both washed clean of our sins and our skins, going young again,
Forgetting why we ever wrinkled or why we
Ever furrowed our brow with the plow of anger

Become dust with me
Insignificant and everywhere
For I will love you even after your
Marrow has become a whisper and your bones;
Nothing but the snickering of gravel
Let us soak in the spaces our shadows left behind
Your skeleton, laced with mine
I will tie your soul to my ankles
And know what it is like to step into a dream

And you will try on my backbone and see how bad
It hurt the day you said you were calling it quits
I don't remember why you left
Or why you came back
I don't know how many years have passed
I′m not really sure years passed at all

All I know is the rain falls;
You kiss me like a rain fall

The sun, it bleaches us clear and every day is a romance
All this to say;
We are already laughing
There is a wedding of earthworms and pebbles
Waiting when our tuxedo skeletons no longer fit
There is a place for our faces to lie planted beside
Forever smiling
There exists a place where we can still be in love
There exists a place where we can be still and in love
Just two gentle skulls


Hey there, pretty girl
You know exactly what you got
And I don't blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the light's so bright
And the money's so right
And it's comin' in every single night

She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life
And she's scared of ending up alone

I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now
Mad 'cause he ain't like me
Oh, you mad 'cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alisha, Catya
I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah, I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in the speaker right now, that's me, that's me
And the voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your ladies
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded
Take a shot for me (oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)
A shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)
(Yeah) a shot for me
Okay look, I'm honest
Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says, "I know you changed
I never see you 'cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, ah
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it
Take a shot for me (oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)
A shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)
A shot for me
Yeah
May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you
And Heaven accept you


Yeah
Yeah
Man
It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her, but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it, and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's, "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat"
Then I leave out and you call me, tell me that you sorry
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep, but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see, it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked as hard if you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
'Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks, we'll probably end up robbing a bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning, oh, it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son, man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
And get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known
'Cause you deserve it
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be something
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've
It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love 'cause when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid, damn
Boohoo, sad story, Black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid, but it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house feel like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you, man, this all new shit
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib, you would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'd be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, then you got to me
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car, yeah
Just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life so worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounceed, but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that
It worked out, man, you deserve it
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be something
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've
Hi, Aubrey
I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this
In this comfortable place

And the times I used to look after you

This song's for you

Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you you're in too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you shawty
Last night we didn't say it, but girl we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind so
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
Yeah

Presidential suite, on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touchdown, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green

Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunning for the title
Lot of people trying to take us viral

Waiter brought the check for the meal

Nah girl, I got it, that's light though

Leave your phone, come to mine
You'll catch a hand in due time
I think, think that I
Could fuck the idea of him outta your mind
You said he rap, he ain't signed, that ain't a good sign
Change your mind, good conversation and some rosé wine
Unless there's some other things you gotta mind
You're my baby, ayy, ayy
The smoke got me talkin' in Dutch
A pill in Ibiza, so what?
She leanin' on me, I'm her crutch
She creamin' on me, I'm her crush
Her photos don't need a retouch
She askin' why haven't I nut
I didn't know we in a rush
Enjoyin' the moment, so hush
My album was payin' her bills
I don't even need a deluxe
Her stomach is flat as fuck
She still fit that shit in her gut somehow
The fat must've went in her butt somehow
I don't even ask her what's up
She sayin' that shit is natural
Don't care if she makin' it up
I never put you in no Uber, girl
I'm always gon' send you a truck
I'm always gon' keep it a buck
You give me that shit and I'm stuck
.30 on my waist
'Cause a lotta broke niggas 'round the way ridin' 'round town
And they lookin' for my face
Gotta pray to God above you, girl, you know that Savage love you
And I hope that you feel the same
Tryna be the one for you, but my nickname true
And I hope that I can change
Girl, you know that Savage love you, girl, you know that Savage love you

You're actin' like a bride-to-be
Behind closed doors, slimin' me
Friends are all advisin' me
Sayin' I could die tryna turn you up
There's three sides to this story, girl
The one you subtweet
The one your group chat gets to read
The one you come and tell to me
I understand it finally
I'm tryna give you highs and you're plannin' our goodbyes
But I turn you up
It's my fault
Burnin' cash like it's lit on fire
Penthouse and some new attire
I fulfilled all of your desires
You don't work, but you act retired
'Cause you know that you're mine and it's my fault
It's my fault, it's my fault, for once I take accountability
It's my fault that you got superpowers on your knees
It's my fault for once, don't keep you grounded on your feet
It's my fault for once, I drain accounts to make you love me
It's my fault for once, it's one-sided loyalty
My fault for once, I'm payin' lawyer fees
Doin' things just to set you free, see you breathe
It's my fault for once, I got the Wagon, G
Got you ridin' 'round with niggas that are nothin' like me
It's my fault for once, that's how you make it seem
It's my fault, it's my fault
You were lost until me
You were lost until me, mm-mm, mhm-mm
You were lost until me
My confidence is super low
Baby M, you know I got a heart of gold
You pawned that shit and hit the road, baby
For goodness sakes, at this rate
Your funeral is finna have like ten caskets on display
One for you, the other nine for everything you're takin' to the grave
You don't play, you don't, you don't, you don't, you
You don't play no games
There's three things I learned from love for free
Only thing really worth chasin' is a dream
People don't know we play roles on screen
Messy, started gettin' trendy, gotta keep it clean
You know I keep it clean
Clean as I can
All weapons formed against me gotta jam
Brought you 'round the dawgs, treat you like the fam'
Shoulda been a wham, bam, thank you ma'am
Know you got my confidence on sale
Case you wanna feel better 'bout yourself
You were lost until me
You were lost until me

How much better can I show my love for you
Than say "I do, I do, I do"?
I do, I do, I do
You may not know right where you're going, but
I do, I do, I do
And all the times you wasn't chosen, well, I'll make it up to you
All of the feelings you're not showing
When your river's overflowing, mmm
It's the truth, swear to you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
And all that you are, I do
My single line of stars in noon
Reflection of the very moon, I do
I do, I do, I do
Show my love for you
Can I show my love for you?
(Can I show my love for you?)

Hold on, hold on, fuck that

Listen
Seeing you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart
Yeah, tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Um, trying to think of the right thing to say

Yeah, I get it
I get it, yeah
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me? I lost my way
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (think about me)
Aw, please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah
Say to you- but 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you- a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other -?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aww, yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you-
Aw, please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Damn
I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the visit
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me, not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my - drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that - is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven
Yeah
I know

When you see them fall down
But you pick 'em up
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout takin' my lane
They ain't even got on the road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too, like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
Never chase it, let it come to you
You out here tellin' everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two
When you see them fall down (yeah)
But you pick 'em up
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know, they'll know
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

I forgot to call to you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time
When the lights don't glow the same way that they use to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor if I pull it together
Make it sooner than later, we won't be here forever
And I realize I waited to know
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go
When the lights don't glow the same way that they use to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor if I pull it together
Make it sooner than later, we won't be here forever
And I realize I waited to know
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
The girl or the world, you see someone gotta lose
I thought I could have it all, do I really gotta choose
What good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time
And what good is bein' famous if I'm never on your mind
Nights fallen, light glowing
And I'm just tryna pay the price owing
And I don't wanna feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga, nice goin', is it worth it, that decision
'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear
So can you do me a favor if I pull it together
Make it sooner than later we won't be here forever
And I realize I waited to know
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else

Yep, I saw it on the internet

Really seem that God wanna test my love for you
Don't know how to express my love
