Bugs/issues: 
- issue with similarity method as it repeated sneds out strnig warning but can be disgarded. the scoring is consisent each run but was not able to figure out why
- Does not recite the audio file of poem but creates an audio file that contains gTTS saying the poem.
- also does not give option to save poem
- Now getting a type error with the audio file. Says I'm giving 2 arguements when there is only one input in the method.

Libraries used/ installations
- SpaCy
- pydantic
- gtts

How it works

Essentially takes in a trigger word that starts the poem off. Reads through an inspiring set of 1 poem and a bunch of drake songs and creates a bigram model of the words used from the inspiring set and words that frequently come after the words. a word is then chosen at random using the Random library and uses that word for the next word in the poem. The scoring is based on using a similarity method through spaCy with twos strings.

Have inlcuded sources at the top of the page of each class I used information I learned.

How working on this system challenged you as a computer scientist?
- This assingment allowed me to act on my creativity in ways I've never done before. Poems and music are things that I'm passionate about so it was cool to think of ways to implement these things at a high level. In terms of code, I've never used certain libraries befroe and being able to implement them and use them to achieve the goal of a poem/song was supper cool. Also not limiting myself to do something mroe simple allowed me to grow as an individual in python.
