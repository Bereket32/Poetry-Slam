How it works

Essentially takes in a trigger word that starts the poem off. Reads through an inspiring set of 1 poem and a bunch of drake songs and creates a bigram model of the words used from the inspiring set and words that frequently come after the words. a word is then chosen at random using the Random library and uses that word for the next word in the poem. The scoring is based on using a similarity method through spaCy with twos strings.
